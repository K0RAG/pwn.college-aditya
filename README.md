## 10. KEY LEARNING POINTS

### E-Waste Management

- **Definition**: Waste from electronic devices no longer fit for original use
- **Scale**: Growing global problem; electronics industry fastest-growing sector
- **Composition**: Complex mixture of metals, plastics, glass, ceramics, hazardous substances

### Environmental Impact (3 Major Pathways)

1. **Air**: Burning, thermal processing → Dioxins, fine particles, respiratory damage
2. **Soil**: Seepage, particle deposition → Heavy metal contamination, crop damage
3. **Water**: Groundwater seepage → Acidification, toxification, ecosystem damage

### Health Risks

- **Primary Effects**: Respiratory problems, neurological disorders, congenital disabilities
- **Hazardous Substances**: Lead, mercury, cadmium, beryllium, arsenic, BFRs, PFAS
- **Bioaccumulation**: Some substances accumulate in body over time

### Circular Economy Solution

- **Goal**: Eliminate waste through product reuse, repair, recycling
- **Key Principles**: Design for longevity, repair, refurbishment, responsible recycling
- **Benefits**: Resource efficiency, pollution reduction, job creation, sustainability

### Practical Solutions

- **Repair Services**: Extend product lifespan, reduce manufacturing
- **Refurbishment**: Second life for functional products
- **Second-Hand Markets**: Extended usage, lower consumer costs
- **Design Improvements**: Modular, repairable, disassemblable products

### Regulatory Framework

- **RoHS Directive**: Restrict hazardous substances in EEE
- **WEEE Directive**: Mandate proper e-waste disposal and recycling
- **EPA Regulations**: U.S. e-waste handling and disposal rules
- **EPR**: Extended Producer Responsibility for product lifecycle
