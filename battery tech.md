## 1. INTRODUCTION TO BATTERIES

### 1.1 Definition

**Battery**: Devices that store energy in the form of chemical energy and convert it when required to electrical energy. Through electrochemical reactions occurring in a battery, electrons are released and flow from one conductor (electrode) to another through an external electric circuit, providing an electric current used to do tasks.

### 1.2 Importance and Applications

**Ubiquity of Batteries**:
- Clocks, watches, motor vehicles
- UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) systems
- TV remote controls, cameras, laptop computers
- Cellular phones, lasers, heart pacemakers
- Children's toys
- Batteries remain an enormous industry with turnover of billions of pounds worldwide

### 1.3 Battery Types Based on Reusability

#### Primary Batteries

**Definition**: Galvanic cells that produce electricity from chemicals sealed when manufactured. Cannot be recharged as cell reaction cannot be reversed efficiently.

**Characteristics**:
- Non-rechargeable ("throw-away" batteries)

## 2. BASIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND BATTERY OPERATION

### 2.1 Fundamental Principle: Redox Reactions

**Core Concept**: Battery operation based on exchange of electrons between two chemical reactions:
- **Oxidation reaction** (loss of electrons)
- **Reduction reaction** (gain of electrons)

**Key Differentiator**: Oxidation and reduction reactions physically separated (unlike rusting processes)

### 2.2 Battery Components and Function

**When reactions physically separated**:
- Load can be inserted between the two reactions
- Electrochemical potential difference = Battery voltage (drives load)
- Exchange of electrons = Current through load
- **External circuit**: Electrons flow through external wire
- **Internal circuit**: Ions flow through electrolyte

### 2.3 Role of Battery Components

**Electrodes**: 
- Physical location where electron transfer occurs
- In many systems (lead-acid, alkaline), electrode is both electron transfer site and chemical reaction component
- In fuel cells, electrode material is inert and only provides electron transfer site

**For Discharging Battery**:
- **Anode**: Oxidation reaction occurs; positive voltage (loses electrons)
- **Cathode**: Reduction reaction occurs; negative voltage (gains electrons)

**Electrolyte**:
- Electrically conducting solution in contact with electrodes
- Transports charged ions between electrodes
- Completes electrical circuit

**Salt Bridge** (if needed):
- Connects two electrode compartments if electrolytes differ
- Contains concentrated electrolyte solution in agar jelly
- Completes electrical circuits

### 2.4 Energy Conversion Process

1. Electrons released from anode
2. Flow through external circuit to cathode
3. Electrons consumed at cathode
4. Ions transported through electrolyte (internal circuit)
5. Electrode and electrolyte materials determine:
   - Electrochemical reactions
   - Charged ions type
   - Energy storage extent
   - Operating voltage
   - Battery performance

## 3. ELECTROCHEMICAL CELLS

### 3.1 Definition and Types

**Electrochemical Cell**: Single arrangement of two electrodes in one or two electrolytes that converts chemical energy into electrical energy (galvanic) or electrical energy into chemical energy (electrolytic).

**Two Main Types**:
1. Galvanic Cells
2. Electrolytic Cells

---

### 3.2 Galvanic Cells

#### Definition

Electrochemical cells that produce electricity as result of spontaneous redox reaction occurring inside. Generally consists of two electrodes dipped in two electrolyte solutions separated by porous diaphragm or connected through salt bridge.

#### Function

- Converts stored chemical energy (from electroactive materials: anode & cathode active materials) directly into electrical energy
- Negatively charged electrons flow from anode to cathode
- Electrons attracted to positive cathode through external circuit

#### Anode vs. Cathode

**Anode**:
- Electrode where oxidation occurs
- Where electrons are produced
- What anions migrate towards
- Has negative sign

**Cathode**:
- Electrode where reduction occurs
- Where electrons are consumed
- What cations migrate towards
- Has positive sign

#### Daniel Cell Example

**Components**:
- Two compartments
- Zinc rod in zinc sulfate solution (Anode compartment)
- Copper rod in copper sulfate solution (Cathode compartment)
- Salt bridge connecting electrolytes

**Oxidation at Zinc Electrode (Anode)**:
$$\text{Zn (s)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} \text{(aq)} + 2e^-$$

- Zinc oxidized, liberates two electrons
- Positive ions flow from salt bridge to cathode
- Zinc electrode becomes lighter

**Reduction at Copper Electrode (Cathode)**:
$$\text{Cu}^{2+} \text{(aq)} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{Cu(s)}$$

- Reduction of Cu²⁺ ions
- Metallic copper deposits on copper rod
- Electrons consumed
- Negative ions flow from salt bridge to anode
- Copper electrode becomes heavier

**Net Reaction (Overall Redox)**:
$$\text{Zn(s)} + \text{Cu}^{2+} \text{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+} \text{(aq)} + \text{Cu(s)}$$

**Electrical Current Generation**:
- When circuit closed, electrons flow zinc → copper through external wire
- Electrons feed Cu²⁺ ions in discharge process
- Electrical energy produced for external work

#### General Galvanic Cell Construction

- Anode: Greater tendency to lose electrons (oxidation)
- Cathode: Greater tendency to undergo reduction
- **In galvanic cell**: Anode = negative; Cathode = positive
- Electrons flow: Negative electrode → Positive electrode
- Conventional current flow: Cathode → Anode

#### Cell Representation

**Convention**:
1. Anode on left; Cathode on right
2. Anode: Metal/Metal ion (concentration) | Electrolyte | Metal
3. Cathode: Electrolyte | Metal ion/Metal
4. Salt bridge: Two vertical lines separating half-cells

**Examples**:
- \(\text{Zn│ZnSO}_4 \text{(1M)║CuSO}_4\text{(1M)│Cu}\)
- \(\text{Cu(s)/Cu}^{2+}\text{(aq)║Ag}^+\text{(aq)/Ag(s)}\)

#### Driving Force

- Pushes negatively charged electrons away from anode
- Pulls electrons toward cathode
- Determines voltage of battery

#### Factors Affecting EMF

### 5.3 For Cell EMF

#### General Form

$$E_{cell} = E^0_{cell} - \frac{2.303RT}{nF} \log\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$

For reaction: aA + bB ↔ cC + dD

#### At 298 K

$$E_{cell} = E^0_{cell} - \frac{0.0591}{n} \log\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}$$

### 5.4 Key Observations from Nernst Equation
