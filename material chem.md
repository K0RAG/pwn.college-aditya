## 1. POLYMERS

### 1.1 Introduction to Polymers

**Definition**: Polymers are giant molecules formed by the combination of several simple molecules having two or more binding sites linked through covalent bonding.

**Etymology**: The word "polymer" is derived from two Greek words:
- **Poly** = Many
- **Meros** = Parts

**Example**: Polythene is formed by the combination of several ethene (ethylene) molecules.

#### Key Concepts

**Monomers**: Simple molecules which are repeating units of the polymer
- Example: Ethene is the monomer for polythene

**Degree of Polymerization (DP)**: 
- Expresses the total number of repeating units (n) in the polymer chain
- Formula: Molecular Weight = DP × Molecular Weight of Repeating Unit
- **High Polymers**: Large number of repeating units
- **Oligomers**: Lower number of repeating units

**Functionality**: Total number of functional groups, bonding sites, or reactive sites present in a monomer
- Common functional groups: –OH, -COOH, -NH₂, -SH, –NCO

**Classification by Functionality**:
| Functionality | Number of Groups | Example | Molecular Structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Monofunctional** | 1 | CH₃CH₂OH | One –OH group |
| **Bifunctional** | 2 | HO-CH₂-CH₂–OH | Two –OH groups |
| **Trifunctional** | 3 | HOOC-CH₂-CH(COOH)-CH₂-COOH | Three -COOH groups |

### 1.3 Structure and Properties of Polymers

#### A. Strength

**Based on Forces of Attraction**

**Linear and Branched Polymers**:
- Individual chains held together by weak intermolecular forces
- Strength increases with chain length (increased molecular weight)
- **Minimum chain length for mechanical strength**: > 150–200 carbon atoms
- Below this threshold: Soft, gummy, and brittle at low temperature
- Intermolecular forces increased by polar groups: –CO (carbonyl), –OH (hydroxyl)

**Cross-linked Polymers**:
- Monomeric units held by covalent forces (primary bonds)
- Greater strength than linear and branched polymers

**Based on Slipping Power**

**Definition**: Movement of molecules sliding over one another

**Examples**:
- **Polyethylene**: Simple, uniform molecules → High slipping power → Lower strength
- **Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)**: Bulky chlorine atoms restrict movement → Low slipping power → Higher strength
- **Cross-linked Polymers**: Totally restricted movement due to covalent bonds → Strong, rigid, tough

#### B. Plastic Deformation

**Definition**: Permanent deformation in shape when polymer subjected to heat or pressure (or both)

**Significance**: Enables molding of plastics

**Observations**:
- **Linear Polymers**: Greatest plastic deformation (weak intermolecular forces)
- **Branched Polymers**: Moderate deformation
- **Cross-linked Polymers**: No slippage (strong covalent bonds throughout) → Total destruction under extreme conditions

#### C. Crystallinity

**Definition**: Relative arrangement of polymer chains with respect to each other

**Two States**:

| Property | Amorphous | Crystalline |
|---|---|---|
| **Molecular Arrangement** | Completely random | Regular, ordered |
| **Formation Conditions** | Bulky substituents, irregular chains | Linear chains, no bulky substituents |
| **Chain Packing** | Loose | Dense |
| **Tensile Strength** | Lower | High |
| **Impact/Wear Resistance** | Lower | High |
| **Density** | Lower | Higher |
| **Fusion Temperature** | Lower | Higher (sharp softening point) |
| **Rigidity** | Lower | Greater |

**Examples**:
- **Amorphous**: Polystyrene (does not crystallize easily due to low symmetry)
- **Crystalline**: PVC, Polypropylene
- **General State**: Most polymers have amorphous with some degree of crystallinity

#### D. Chemical Resistance

**Principle**: "Like dissolves like" – polymers more soluble in structurally similar solvents

**Polar Polymers**:
- Contain polar groups (–OH, -COOH)
- Dissolve in polar solvents (water, alcohol)
- Resistant to non-polar solvents

**Non-polar Polymers**:
- Dissolve in non-polar solvents (benzene, toluene)
- Resistant to polar solvents

**General Rules**:
1. High molecular weight → Decreased solubility
2. Crystalline polymers → Higher resistance than less crystalline polymers
3. Greater crystallinity → Lesser solubility

**Application**: Plastic bottles for drug storage (must resist chemical interactions)

#### E. Elasticity

**Definition**: Ability to return to original shape after deformation

**Mechanism**: Uncoiling and recoiling of molecular chains upon force application

**States**:
- **Unstretched**: Irregularly coiled, entangled snarls (amorphous state) → Opaque, warm
- **Stretched**: Snarls disentangle, straighten into proper chain orientation (crystalline state)

**Requirements for Elasticity**:
- Individual chains must not break even after prolonged stretching
- Suitable crosslinking in chains
- Non-polar groups or side groups in repeating unit

---

### 1.4 Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)

**Definition**: Temperature below which amorphous polymer is brittle, hard, glassy; above which it becomes flexible, soft, rubbery

**Key Characteristics**:
- Amorphous polymers lack sharp melting points (have softening point)
- Transition from glassy (rigid) to rubbery (flexible) state

**States**:
- **Glassy State (T < Tg)**: Hard, brittle plastic; no molecular motion; shatters if hit
- **Rubber State (T > Tg)**: Soft, flexible; segmental motion possible

**Factors Affecting Glass Transition Temperature**

| Factor | Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Chain Geometry** | Regular geometry → Higher Tg | Regular chains have higher Tg |
| **Bulky Groups** | Increase Tg | Polyethylene Tg = -110°C (no bulky groups) |
| **Polar Groups** | Increase Tg | Nylon 6: Tg = 50°C (strong H-bonding) |
| **Molecular Weight** | Increases Tg (up to ~20,000) | Higher MW = Higher Tg |
| **Crystallinity** | Crystalline > Amorphous Tg | Arrangement enhances Tg |
| **Plasticizers** | Reduce Tg | Dibutyl phthalate, diacetyl phthalate |

**Significance**:
- Helps choose right processing temperature
- Measure of polymer flexibility
- Indicates thermal expansion, heat capacity, electrical and mechanical properties

### 1.5 Molecular Weight of Polymers

**Why "Average" Molecular Weight?**: Polymers comprise molecules of different molecular weights

#### A. Number-Average Molecular Weight (Mn)

**Definition**: Total mass of all molecules divided by total number of molecules

**Formula**: 
$$M_n = \frac{\sum n_i M_i}{\sum n_i}$$

Where:
- ni = number of molecules of type i
- Mi = molecular weight of type i

#### B. Weight-Average Molecular Weight (Mw)

**Definition**: Sum of fractional masses each molecule contributes according to its mass ratio

**Formula**: 
$$M_w = \frac{\sum n_i M_i^2}{\sum n_i M_i}$$

#### C. Polydispersity Index (PDI)

**Definition**: Ratio of weight-average to number-average molecular weight

**Formula**: 
$$\text{PDI} = \frac{M_w}{M_n}$$

**Interpretation**:
- **PDI = 1**: Monodisperse system (all molecules equal length); Mw = Mn
- **PDI > 1**: Polydisperse system (varying molecule sizes)

**Typical Values**:
- Natural proteins: PDI ≈ 1
- Synthetic polymers: PDI = 1.5 to 5

#### Molecular Weight Calculation Examples

**Example 1**: Polymer with 1, 2, 3 & 4 molecules having MW 10⁵, 2×10⁵, 3×10⁵, 4×10⁵

Mn = [1(1×10⁵) + 2(2×10⁵) + 3(3×10⁵) + 4(4×10⁵)] / (1+2+3+4) = 3.0×10⁵

Mw = [1(1×10⁵)² + 2(2×10⁵)² + 3(3×10⁵)² + 4(4×10⁵)²] / [1(1×10⁵) + 2(2×10⁵) + 3(3×10⁵) + 4(4×10⁵)] = 3.3×10⁵

PDI = 3.3×10⁵ / 3.0×10⁵ = 1.1

---

### 1.6 Determination of Molecular Weight: Viscometry

**Technique**: Viscosity average molecular weight (Mv)

**Principle**: Viscosity of polymer solution correlates with molecular weight

**Mark-Houwink Equation**:
$$[\eta] = KM^a$$

Where:
- [η] = Intrinsic viscosity
- M = Molecular weight
- K, a = Constants (specific for polymer/solvent/temperature system)

**Graphical Analysis**:
$$\log[\eta] = \log K + a \log M$$

- Plotting log [η] vs log M gives straight line
- Slope = a; Ordinate intercept = log K
